On-line code. No real global awareness unlike A* would have cuz will have to discretize

Hybrid A* would probably be best: ie for each node, check 4 directions to expand toward. And for each direction to expand, try all four combinations.
BUUUUT this may not be able to get correct orientations/ positions in the maze unless very small resolution of distance is used. So will also be quite expensive.

RRT* to cleanup/smoothen path

Better way to maintain less cluttered paths

Use RRT-connect, so that a good point that appears at the end of the hallway will lead to a quick fast exploration path.

Use full domain to sample every now and then, even in the expansion phase so that lucky connections can be made. 

Implement 10% probability to go toward goal
